1) R: character -> mpfr   "3.14159265358979323846264" -> mpfr

2) NOTA BENE:  Have  "mpfrMatrix", dim(.) <- ..; t(), %*%, crossprod()...

 -  <mpfr> %*% <mpfr>    should work like with numeric vectors
 -  <mpfr> %*% t(<mpfr>)  ditto

 -  <mpfr>[i] & <mpfrMatrix>[i]  work
    but   <mpfrMatrix> [i,j]  not yet

 -->  want things to work like
          which(<mpfrMatrix> == ., arr.ind = TRUE)  - ok
          outer(....)                               - not yet

 [No longer sure if this is true :]
 For this, we must ensure that the methods are used, instead of the
 .Primitive  base functions :

 One way: --> see ~/R/MM/NUMERICS/bessel-large-x.R
                  --------------------------------

  ## really interesting is  bI(x., nu)  {for "mpfr" argument}:
  ## it uses outer(), but that needs to dispatch on, e.g. "^",
  ## i.e., not only look at "base"
  environment(outer) <- as.environment("package:Rmpfr")
  environment(dim) <- as.environment("package:Rmpfr")
  environment(dimnames) <- as.environment("package:Rmpfr")
  environment(`dim<-`) <- as.environment("package:Rmpfr")
  environment(`dimnames<-`) <- as.environment("package:Rmpfr")
  environment(which) <- as.environment("package:Rmpfr")
