2) NOTA BENE:  Have  "mpfrMatrix", dim(.) <- ..; t(), %*%, crossprod()...

 -  <mpfr> %*% <mpfr>    should work like with numeric vectors
 -  <mpfr> %*% t(<mpfr>)  ditto

 -  <mpfr>[i] & <mpfrMatrix>[i]  work
    but   <mpfrMatrix> [i,j]  not yet

 -->  want things to work like
          which(<mpfrMatrix> == ., arr.ind = TRUE)  - ok
          outer(....)                               - not yet

 [No longer sure if this is true :]
 For this, we must ensure that the methods are used, instead of the
 .Primitive  base functions :

 One way: --> see ~/R/MM/NUMERICS/bessel-large-x.R
                  --------------------------------

  ## really interesting is  bI(x., nu)  {for "mpfr" argument}:
  ## it uses outer(), but that needs to dispatch on, e.g. "^",
  ## i.e., not only look at "base"
  environment(outer) <- as.environment("package:Rmpfr")
  environment(dim) <- as.environment("package:Rmpfr")
  environment(dimnames) <- as.environment("package:Rmpfr")
  environment(`dim<-`) <- as.environment("package:Rmpfr")
  environment(`dimnames<-`) <- as.environment("package:Rmpfr")
  environment(which) <- as.environment("package:Rmpfr")


4) format() should get more (optional) arguments; e.g. an option to
    [ round() after decimal ], and one to drop trailing zeros,
   see format.default

5) I'd like seq() methods, but that seems currently impossible because of
   a "design infelicity" in base::seq.default  --- ???? E-mail to R-core ??
   --> R/mpfr.R

6) It is "wrong" that the class "Mnumber" also extends "character", "list";
   but it's not clear we can find better definitions, see R/AllClasses.R

7) Add tests for hypot() & atan2() to tests/special-fun-ex.R

8) round(x, .) & signif(x, .) currently return "mpfr" numbers of the same precision.
   That *looks* ugly.
   Potentially add a swith 'keepPrec = FALSE' -- i.e. by default *reduce*
   precision to "match" 'digits' argument.


10) For *complex* arithmetic, build interface to the  "MPC" library
   ---> http://www.multiprecision.org/mpc -- which is LGPL and itself
   builds on MPFR and GMP.
