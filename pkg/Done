1) R: character -> mpfr   "3.14159265358979323846264" -> mpfr

3) "Arith" and "Compare" methods currently ``lose dim + dimnames''
   for "mpfrArray" (& "mpfrMatrix")

  The solution is a bit tedious because the Ops do recycling pretty
  generously for vectors,
  but pretty stringently when one of the operands is a matrix.

  If the other part is a matrix their dim() must be identical,
  if just a vector, its length must be a divisor of  length(<matrix>)
