Description: Arithmetic (via S4 classes and methods) for
  arbitrary precision floating point numbers, including transcendental
  ("special") functions.  To this end, the package interfaces to
  the 'LGPL' licensed 'MPFR' (Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliable) Library
  which itself is based on the 'GMP' (GNU Multiple Precision) Library.
