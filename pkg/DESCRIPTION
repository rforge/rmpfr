Type: Package
Title: R MPFR - Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliable
Version: 0.3-0
Date: 2011-05-11
Author: Martin Maechler
Maintainer: Martin Maechler <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>
Depends: methods, R (>= 2.11.0)
SystemRequirements: MPFR (MP Floating-Point Reliable Library, http://mpfr.org/)
  and GMP (GNU Multiple Precision library, http://gmplib.org/), see README
Description: Rmpfr provides S4 classes and methods for
  arithmetic including transcendental ("special") functions for
  arbitrary precision floating point numbers. To this end, it interfaces to
  the LGPL'ed MPFR (Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliable) Library
  which itself is based on the GMP (GNU Multiple Precision) Library.
License: GPL (>= 2)
NoNamespace: There is currently no NAMESPACE, as I want one package with
  heavy use of S4 methods and classes and no namespace.  This may well change.
